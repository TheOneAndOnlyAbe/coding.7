Question 2: 7,960MB of total memory. 6,572MB of free memory. It
	    makes sense that there would be less free memory
	    total memory because there are processes running.
	    It wouldnt make sense for all memory to be free or
	    weirder, have more free memory than total memory.

Question 4: The free memory goes down by the amount specified,
	    and used memory goes up by that same amount.
	    If I do ./memory-user 20, free memory decreases by
	    20mb and used memory increases by 20mb. Yes it
	    matched my expectations. It wouldn't make sense for
	    free memory and used memory to increase/decrease
	    by random values nor would it make sense for them
	    to remain the same values. However, this exact
	    thing happens when I put in a large number like
	    6400.

Question 6: I just printed getpid().

Question 7: There's a lot more going on than I expected. There
	    are 24 things dividing the memory given to
	    memory-user.

Question 8: Again, the memory given to memory-user is divided
	    among 24 entities, but they all add up CLOSE to
	    the amount given. For example, I gave the program
	    1000mb but only using 979.056mb. I also gave it
	    320mb but its using only 314.996mb. I did not
	    expect it to not use up all of that memory since
	    it's allocating that memory in an array.
